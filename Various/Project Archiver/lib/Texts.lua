source files will be DELETED and replaced by new "minimized"

This will make any other RPP that uses the original files UNUSABLE!
The only project that will work with those new files is this one.

This cannot be undone!

[[This will make any other RPP that uses files in the media folder UNUSABLE!
The only project that will work with those new files is this one.

This is especially risky if your media folder is your project's root folder,
as this will delete any media file which exists in this folder, which may be

You can hover over them to see each one.

Do you accept the risks?]]

Are you crazy?!

While I'm pretty damn sure everything works
you should still probably make sure to have
a backup of this project and all of its
media files, until you're certain that
this script did its job correctly.

I'm not taking responsibility in case
anything goes wrong.

Which reminds me - please let me know at the
Reaper forums if anything does go wrong so
I can fix it.



But everything wil probably be ok :)
