-- THOUGHTS and TODOS -----------------
---------------------------------------

-- Subproject Support
--  (the problem is that if they're internal they will need to be collected themselves,
--  and their own assets will need to be protected so as to not be deleted by the script.
--  If they're external there's nothing much to do, as I can't collect them anyway, for the same reason,
--  so then they're not really backup up, collected or minimized. Therefore, for now, I think it's best 
--  let the user deal with this manually)

-- TODO export current settings as action
-- TODO delete peaks file peaks folder if relative
-- TODO option to delete session backups
-- TODO (later) figure out section
